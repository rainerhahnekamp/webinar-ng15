This project demonstrates the main steps for a migration from Angular 13 to Angular 14.

It covers Strictly Typed Forms, Page Titles, Standalone Components & APIs.

For each step, there exists a separate branch which depends on the former "step branch":

1. 01-update-core-cli: Runs `ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`
2. 02-typed-forms: Uses typed forms instead of the untyped that are generated by the update script
3. 03-page-titles: Uses the new `title` property in the router configuration to show an individual title in the browser per route.
4. 04-scams: Intermediary steps where every component gets assigned a single module.
5. 05-scs: Migrates the SCAMs to Standalone Components
6. 06-bootstrap: Uses the new `bootstrapApplication` method instead of the `AppModule´.
7. 07-routing: Uses the `importProvidersFrom` which partially replaces the import of `NgModules`.
